   <h3> Mexico's National Soccer Team </h3>
   My favorite soccer team is Mexico's National Soccer team. My reasoning for this is that my parents are from Mexico and I grew up watching the team play for as long<br> 
   as I can remember. In Mexico, soccer is a huge part of the countries culture meaning that most people are very passionate for the sport. Whenever the team has a match<br>
   every Mexico fan gets their apperal ready and gets together with family and friends in order to watch the game and support El Tri. The National team may not always be <br>
   ranked the highest in international standings, however they are very persistent and always give it their all. That is why they are my favorite sports team.<br>

   <h2> Hugo Sanchez </h2>
   <img src="https://www.soccer.com/wcm/connect/aba0b70e-cd3d-4458-af3a-374d8a903f09/MX1-Sanchez-624x982.jpg?MOD=AJPERES&CACHEID=ROOTWORKSPACE-aba0b70e-cd3d-4458-af3a-374d8a903f09-lIAC4Cy" alt="sanchez" style="width:300px;height:500px;"><br>
No other Mexican footballer has scored as many goals in Europe as Hugo Sánchez. After a few seasons in the local league and a year with the San Diego Sockers, Hugo joined Atlético<br>
Madrid. He played four seasons with the Red and Whites before moving to Real Madrid, where he spent seven years playing with some of the finest footballers.Sánchez won the Pichichi<br>
award five times, four of them with Real Madrid, and helped the Merengues secure five La Liga titles, one Copa del Rey and three Supercopas de España. Hugo was recognized by the IFFHS<br> 
as CONCACAF's best Player of the Century and named in Real Madrid’s all-time greatest XI. He also represented Mexico in three World Cups (1978, 1986 and 1994); however, he only scored<br> 
29 goals, thus he sits seventh in the all-time scorers list. Sánchez was fast, strong and knew where he needed to be in the exact moment. His accuracy and fierceness were key to his<br> 
success. He held the Real Madrid record for most goals scored in one season (38) for 21 years, including his famous bicycle kick; Cristiano Ronaldo broke it in 2011 (40).<br>
   <h2> History </h2>
   Mexico's National team first played in 1862 and since them has grown into one of the biggest soccer teams in the world. Their nickname is El Tri. The all time scorer fr the team is <br>
   forward Havier Hernandez, also known as "Chicharito" with 48 goals. Mexico is home to top class players such as Hugo Sanchez, Luiz Hernandez, Rafael Marquez and others. Mexico has won <br>
   10 Gold Cups, 1 Confederates Cup, and have been the runner up in Copa America twice in their history.<br>
