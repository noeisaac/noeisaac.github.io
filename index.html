<h3> About Me </h3>
<body> 
  My name is Noe Isaac Cervantes and I am a 17 year old who lives in San Diego. I am a senior at Canyon Crest Academy and I hope
  to go onto studying either electrical or computer engineering in college. My reasoning behind creating my own web page is to 
  introduce others to the variety of foods, movies, and hobbies that are avaliable and to find others with similar interests to me.
  I live at home with my mom, dad, and my younger brother. My brother looks up to me which is why I always try to set a good example for him.</br>
