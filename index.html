<h2> About Me </h2> 
  My name is Noe Isaac Cervantes and I am a 17 year old who lives in San Diego. I am a senior at Canyon Crest Academy and I hope<br>
  to go onto studying either electrical or computer engineering in college. My reasoning behind creating my own web page is to<br>
  introduce others to the variety of foods, movies, and hobbies that are avaliable and to find others with similar interests to me.<br>
  I live at home with my mom, dad, and my younger brother. My brother looks up to me which is why I always try to set a good example for him.<br>
