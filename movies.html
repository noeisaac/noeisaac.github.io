   <h2> Movie Review </h2>
   I personally really enjoyed the movie. I felt that it was a great example of meeting new people that you may not necesarily like right off the bat. It showed that no matter <br>
   how differenet people may be from one another they all have similar struggles and are all humans, or toys in this case, after all. In the end both toys were able to get along <br>
   with one another and become friends. Which I reall feel shows important life lessons to children who viewed the movie.<br>
